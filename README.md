# Fake Ext [F-Ext]
F-Ext is a chrome extension built for anyone who wants to display the extension icon of their choice!

## How It Works
You need to have access one of the following
* Your own personal email 
* The developer option on the extension page

With one of these, unzip the repo if needed, then upload it by clicking load unpacked!

It will show the extension icon you choose, and it will appear to others that you just have the extension you picked, but really you don't!

## Plans
* I wanna add more to this such as a menu for the extension for on the go changing icons, with a variety of extensions to mimic.
* I wanna see if I can maybe make it enable and disable the chrome extension it mimics, so if perhaps you are being watching it can turn on the real one, without it being suspicious.

## Note
I will be releasing this soon for full use soon hopefully, Im still working on this.

I wanna be able to change the icons with a menu by clicking the extension in the corner, if possible, this is actually my first time with chrome extensions.

Also please note, using this is NOT a working alternative to the real extension, so if you use this on an account without the actual extension, it will not do the same thing as the other one, this is simply a "blank extension" just with the extension icon.
